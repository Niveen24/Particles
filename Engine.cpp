TODO:
	Engine()
		call create on m_Window to populate RenderWindow member variable
		call VideoMode::getDesktopMode() to get the screen resolution


TODO:
	run()
		Construct a local Clock object to track Time per frame
		(The time differential (dt) since the last frame will be passed into update)
		Construct a local Particle to be used for the unit tests.
		After the unit tests are complete, create your game loop:
			Loop while m_Window is open
			Restart the clock (this will return the time elapsed since the last frame)
			Convert the clock time to seconds
			Call input
			Call update
			Call draw

TODO:
	input()
		Poll the Windows event queue
		Handle the Escape key pressed and closed events so your program can exit
		Handle the left mouse button pressed event
		Create a loop to construct 5 particles (I used 5, you can change this if you want)
		The numPoints parameter in the Particle constructor is a random number in the range [25:50]
		Pass the position of the mouse click into the Particle constructor so it has a starting position



TODO:
	update(float dtAsSeconds)
		The general idea here is to loop through m_particles and call update on each Particle in the vector whose ttl (time to live) has not expired
		If a particle's ttl has expired, it must be erased from the vector
		This is best done with an iterator-based for-loop
		Don't automatically increment the iterator for each iteration
		if getTTL() > 0.0
			Call update on that Particle
				Pass in the time differential since the last frame (dt)
			increment the iterator
		else
			erase the element the iterator points to
			erase returns an iterator that points to the next element after deletion, or end if it is the end of the vector
				Assign the iterator to this return value
			Do not increment the iterator (if you do you might increment past the end of the vector after you delete the last element)

TODO:
	draw()
		clear the window
		Loop through each Particle in m_Particles
			Pass each element into m_Window.draw()
			Note:  This will use polymorphism to call your Particle::draw() function
		display the window
